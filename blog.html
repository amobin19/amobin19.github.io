	<h2>#0 Welcome to Blogging with iMan!</h2>
	<p class="firstP"><strong>What is this blog? Why am I doing this? What will come of this blog? Read below to find out!</strong></p>
	<p>Hi everyone! I'm iMan, well more formally known as Ayman. Thanks for taking the time out of your day to check this out. I know that everyone could be doing other things like work, school, Netflix, gym, eating, or whatever it is that you could be doing. Iâ€™m going to try to make your read worthwhile.</p>
	<p>So what is this blog? Why am I doing this? What will come of this blog? Through this blog you'll get some personal narrative about my journey through the tech world, my opinion on certain technologies, my learning experience as a I pick up new technologies, and some information about by career in technology. Do you see a bit of commonality about what I just said? It's TECHNOLOGY! The world of technology is so big and continually growing, so I'm using this blog to sort of diary what I'm doing right now and keep track of where I go in this giant community going forward whether it may be through my usage of my iPhone, learning a new coding languages, or career shifts in this field!</p>
	<p>Why am I qualified to write this blog? Why am I doing this? I'm writing about technology so I should have some background in tech, right? Well duh. I'm a 4th year at the University of Virginia hopefully graduating in the next couple of weeks as part of the Class of 2019 with a degree in Computer Engineering! I have also accepted a full-time position after my graduation as a Software Engineer for the company of Freddie Mac where I will be working in DevOps/Cloud Engineering! Through my time at UVA I have learned a lot, all the way from the lowest level with physics and hardware all the way to the highest level with application development. Hopefully from an academic standpoint you can see that I meet the basic criteria for having some knowledge in tech. However, anyone could have an education in technology so why am I actually doing this? I want this to serve as a casual, fun read for you about what is going on in my personal experiences in tech. My goal is that these posts shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes of your time and that you get something out of it at least from my standpoint.</p>
	<p>WARNING: Even though I have all of these experiences through the last 4 years, this does not mean in any way that you should take my word for everything I say. I'm not a tech guru. I'm just an ant, not even in an ant hill but in whole universe of this field. This is all based on my point of view and there are certainly multiple angles to anything and everything I could say. My point of view is just one of them.</p>
	<p>If you have made it to this point, you are amazing! I hope that these blog serves you well. I hope you enjoy what is to come. I hope you are just as excited as I am to take this stride!</p>

	<h2>#1 The Major Decision</h2>
	<p class="firstP"><strong>Electrical Engineering (EE) vs. Computer Science (CS) vs. Computer Engineering (CPE)</strong></p>
	<p>Hi everyone! Welcome back! If you're back here reading this again, that probably means that you had a even the tiniest bit of amusement from this blog. Which is amazing. You're amazing. So as you can see, this is a pretty informal blog. I want to keep the vibe as mellow and chilled out as possible. Some information you should know about this site. I developed it. I'm not using some online software blog tool like Wix or Wordpress. Everything that you see infront of you I created from scratch using web development tools like HTML, CSS, JS, etc. I haven't done anything with the back end yet. If you don't know what that is, it's basically how information is saved on a website. Front-end is basically the development of static web page without saving information in a nutshell. I'll do a front-end/back-end post later on. I'll develop the site more as summer approaches and hopefully add more functionality such as user comments, forums, make the site more pretty etc.</p>
	<p>So for today's topic I'm going to expand more upon my major and hopefully answer the question I hear a lot "what's the difference between computer engineering and computer science and electrical engineering?"</p>
	<p>I'm gonna start this by explaining a theoretical spectrum which goes from bottom up. When I'm explaining this, think of your desktop, laptop, or cell phone. All three of these items are made up of multiple components but are all made up of the physical components (the hardware) which powers your device and runs applications (software) which adds functionality to your device. In simplest terms EE majors focus their learning on the hardware (the lower level of the spectrum), designing devices which power your devices. CS majors focus their learning on the software (higher level of the spectrum), designing applications which your device runs. CPE majors focus their learning on the area in between. CPE majors are responsible for understanding the integration between the hardware and software and designing technology which can effectively combine the two. This requires an understanding of both hardware and software. For that reason, the CPE curriculum at UVA requires students to take classes in both the EE department and the CS department.</p>
	<p>Now you might be thinking "why can't everyone do CPE if it requires the knowledge of both hardware and software?" My response to that would be that as a CPE major I have a good fundamental understanding of each area that builds a computer, but I lack a general expertise that a CS major or an EE major has in their respective fields. The reason I have selected this major is because it allows me to explore all areas of building a computer system and I can focus my learning on anything that I am specifically interested in.</p>
	<p>Coming into UVA, I always thought that I'd be an EE major. My philosophy was that "you can't have software without the hardware to run it on." However I learned that I enjoyed developing software and I liked visually seeing my work through the usage of software applications. The reason I did not do just pure CS is because I still wanted to have the ability to understand the lower level hardware design. I have the ability, should I choose to do so, develop hardware or software (whatever I'm passionate about) in my future. I love having that option in my hands rather than being constrained to one specific field.</p>
	<p>Being a CPE major I have enjoyed being able to speak with EE students as well as CS students. I enjoyed having the option through this major to decide what I'm passioante about. I've had my downs through my electronics, circuit analysis, and OS classes but I've also had a lot of ups throught my Web App Development and Robotics classes.</p>
	<p>I hope this post helped you all learn a bit more on the differences between the 3 majors. If you take anything away from this, know that you can be successful in any of the 3 majors. If you are passionate about physically building the technologies, then EE might be your passion. If you are passionate about building applications, then CS might be your path. If you are unsure like me, but are interested in computer technologies, then CPE might be your field. Just know that opportunites are out there for all 3 of these and not any single one of these are better than the other.</p>
	<p>Thanks for reading this if you have! Hope that you have learned something from this, whether it might be about me or about the difference/similarites between the majors. Till next time!</p>
