	<h2>#0 Welcome to Blogging with iMan!</h2>
	<p class="firstP"><strong>What is this blog? Why am I doing this? What will come of this blog? Read below to find out!</strong></p>
	<p>Hi everyone! I'm iMan, well more formally known as Ayman. Thanks for taking the time out of your day to check this out. I know that everyone could be doing other things like work, school, Netflix, gym, eating, or whatever it is that you could be doing. I’m going to try to make your read worthwhile.</p>
	<p>So what is this blog? Why am I doing this? What will come of this blog? Through this blog you'll get some personal narrative about my journey through the tech world, my opinion on certain technologies, my learning experience as a I pick up new technologies, and some information about my career in technology. Do you see a bit of commonality about what I just said? It's TECHNOLOGY! The world of technology is so big and continually growing, so I'm using this blog to sort of diary what I'm doing right now and keep track of where I go in this giant community going forward whether it may be through my usage of my iPhone, learning a new coding language, or career shifts in this field!</p>
	<p>Why am I qualified to write this blog? Why am I doing this? I'm writing about technology so I should have some background in tech, right? Well duh. I'm a 4th year at the University of Virginia hopefully graduating in the next couple of weeks as part of the Class of 2019 with a degree in Computer Engineering! I have also accepted a full-time position after my graduation as a Software Engineer for the company of Freddie Mac where I will be working in DevOps/Cloud Engineering! Through my time at UVA I have learned a lot, all the way from the lowest level with physics and hardware all the way to the highest level with application development. Hopefully from an academic standpoint you can see that I meet the basic criteria for having some knowledge in tech. However, anyone could have an education in technology so why am I actually doing this? I want this to serve as a casual, fun read for you about what is going on through my personal experiences in tech. My goal is that these posts shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes of your time and that you get something out of it at least from my standpoint.</p>
	<p>WARNING: Even though I have all of these experiences through the last 4 years, this does not mean in any way that you should take my word for everything I say. I'm not a tech guru. I'm just an ant, not even in an ant hill but in a whole universe of this field. This is all based on my point of view and there are certainly multiple angles to anything and everything I could say. My point of view is just one of them.</p>
	<p>If you have made it to this point, you are amazing! I hope that this blog serves you well. I hope you enjoy what is to come. I hope you are just as excited as I am to take this stride!</p>

	<h2>#1 The Major Decision</h2>
	<p class="firstP"><strong>Electrical Engineering (EE) vs. Computer Science (CS) vs. Computer Engineering (CPE)</strong></p>
	<p>Hi everyone! Welcome back! If you're back here reading this again, that probably means that you had a even the tiniest bit of amusement from this blog. Which is amazing. You're amazing. So as you can see, this is a pretty informal blog. I want to keep the vibe as mellow and chilled out as possible. Some information you should know about this site. I developed it. I'm not using some online software blog tool like Wix or Wordpress. Everything that you see infront of you I created from scratch using web development tools like HTML, CSS, JS, etc. I haven't done anything with the back end yet. If you don't know what that is, it's basically how information is saved on a website. Front-end is basically the development of static web pages without saving information in a nutshell. I'll do a front-end/back-end post later on. I'll develop the site more as summer approaches and hopefully add more functionality such as user comments, forums, make the site more pretty etc.</p>
	<p>So for today's topic I'm going to expand more upon my major and hopefully answer the question I hear a lot "what's the difference between computer engineering and computer science and electrical engineering?"</p>
	<p>I'm gonna start this by explaining a theoretical spectrum which goes from bottom up. When I'm explaining this, think of your desktop, laptop, or cell phone. All three of these items are made up of multiple components but are all made up of the physical components (the hardware) which powers your device and runs applications (software) which adds functionality to your device. In simplest terms EE majors focus their learning on the hardware (the lower level of the spectrum), designing devices which power your devices. CS majors focus their learning on the software (higher level of the spectrum), designing applications which your device runs. CPE majors focus their learning on the area in between. CPE majors are responsible for understanding the integration between the hardware and software and designing technology which can effectively combine the two. This requires an understanding of both hardware and software. For that reason, the CPE curriculum at UVA requires students to take classes in both the EE department and the CS department.</p>
	<p>Now you might be thinking "why can't everyone do CPE if it requires the knowledge of both hardware and software?" My response to that would be that as a CPE major I have a good fundamental understanding of each area that builds a computer, but I lack a general expertise that a CS major or an EE major has in their respective fields. The reason I have selected this major is because it allows me to explore all areas of building a computer system and I can focus my learning on anything that I am specifically interested in.</p>
	<p>Coming into UVA, I always thought that I'd be an EE major. My philosophy was that "you can't have software without the hardware to run it on." However I learned that I enjoyed developing software and I liked visually seeing my work through the usage of software applications. The reason I did not do just pure CS is because I still wanted to have the ability to understand the lower level hardware design. I have the ability, should I choose to do so, develop hardware or software (whatever I'm passionate about) in my future. I love having that option in my hands rather than being constrained to one specific field.</p>
	<p>Being a CPE major I have enjoyed being able to speak with EE students as well as CS students. I enjoyed having the option through this major to decide what I'm passionate about. I've had my downs through my electronics, circuit analysis, and OS classes but I've also had a lot of ups through my Web App Development and Robotics classes.</p>
	<p>I hope this post helped you all learn a bit more on the differences between the 3 majors. If you take anything away from this, know that you can be successful in any of the 3 majors. If you are passionate about physically building the technologies, then EE might be your passion. If you are passionate about building applications, then CS might be your path. If you are unsure like me, but are interested in computer technologies, then CPE might be your field. Just know that opportunites are out there for all 3 of these and not any single one of these are better than the other.</p>
	<p>Thanks for reading this if you have! Hope that you have learned something from this, whether it might be about me or about the differences/similarites between the majors. Till next time!</p>

	<h2>#2 What's Clouding Your Mind?</h2>
	<p class="firstP"><strong>What is the “cloud”? How did I get into it?</strong></p>
	<p>Hello people of Earth and beyond! Today I hope to enlighten you all with a little brain dump on what the “cloud” really is. Before I get started, I wanna apologize for the huge gap since my last post. Lets just say some things like college graduation, a new career, and an epic pandemic got in the way of me writing posts since my last one. Hopefully I can keep this momentum going.</p>
	<p>Anyway, let’s get to it! I’d like to think that I’m at least somewhat qualified to be talking about this topic today as fortunately I have been able to successfully achieve 2 AWS certifications to this point (I’ll talk more about what AWS is as you keep reading). I’d like to kick things off with how I even got involved and interested in this topic of the “cloud” in the first place with a little anecdote.</p>
	<p>There I was, sitting in the library at the University of Virginia with possibly the worst class enrollment time for the coming semester. There’s been a buzz going around grounds that “Cloud Computing” with Professor Humphrey is a must for students in the CS department. I’m gonna cut straight to the chase, my enrollment time was possibly the last one and I did not get into the class. I think I was position 120 something on the waitlist for a class of 80. So yeah, I was bummed since I was about to enter my final semester of undergrad and I didn’t get into the class I wanted.</p>
	<p>I think not getting into the class was the pivot moment for me in the start of my young cloud journey. I did a little bit of research into the syllabus of the class, thinking what’s all the buzz about. Was it an easy A or what? I started looking through the curriculum and I was amazed at all the different opportunities there are with this technology and just from one look at the course syllabus I knew that this was something that gauged my interest. I knew at that point that I could try to learn these things on my own and be a cloud enthusiast.</p>
	<p>So what is the cloud you may ask? The easy answer is to look up at the sky and you see those cotton-ball, poofy looking things? That’s a cloud. End of post...nope! That’s A cloud but it's not the type of cloud I’m talking about. In as basic terms as possible, the cloud is a bunch of servers located at data centers that can be accessed over the internet. You might follow up by asking, “what’s so cool about that?” Well think of it like this, how does it feel knowing that you have almost used up all of your storage on your phone? It makes it more difficult to readily access applications, take more photos, text your loved ones, or even play games. At that point you might be considering getting a new phone. All of that because the storage on your phone is almost at max occupancy. That's where the cloud comes in. </p>
	<p>Do you ever get those notifications that say to upload your data into the cloud and then all of a sudden a bunch of space will free up on your device? If you do that, you’re  backing up and storing all of your data in the “cloud” which frees up space on your device. You’re not losing your information, rather you have an alternative storage space. If you get a new phone, you can easily restore your new device with the same features from your old device by retrieving it from the cloud. Think of any social media for that matter, how is it possible for you to access your Facebook from any device? It’s because your Facebook account is stored and managed in the cloud. That’s really what the cloud is, a massive storage unit to save information.</p>
	<p>What’s AWS? AWS is known as Amazon Web Services. It’s Amazon’s version of the cloud. It is also one of the largest cloud providers in the world. Lots of companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Netflix all use AWS to store their data. Imagine any of these companies being responsible for their own storage based on the number of people that use their services. They would need to have loads of offices just for servers to hold their customer data. Instead of being responsible for their own storage units, AWS comes in to provide that space for them.</p>
	<p>Since its birth in 2002, AWS has grown to become known as the Operating System of the internet. It has a lot more capabilities than to simply store your data. On the cloud now, individuals and companies have the ability to run their technology applications on top of the base platform that is provided for them. Since then, companies such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM have all begun to develop their own cloud platforms. The giant of them all right now is still AWS. That’s why I have chosen to pursue some of those certifications so I could explore the cloud giant that is the OS of the internet in the modern era.</p>
	<p>I can’t tell you what’s gonna happen in the future. But I can tell you that cloud technology is only going to grow as more and more companies slowly move their infrastructure from their own physical servers to that of cloud servers provided by companies like AWS.</p>

	<h2>#3 A Day in the Life</h2>
	<p class="firstP"><strong>What does my typical day look like?</strong></p>
	<p>Hey everyone! Welcome back to another blog post. Glad to have y’all keep reading these. So for today I thought I’d change it up a bit and do “A Day in the Life” post about my day as a Software Engineer at Freddie Mac. I’m feeling pretty nostalgic working from home and missing my time at the office pre-COVID19 so I thought why not write about it and give everyone a little peek into my world. So here we go!</p>
	<p>I normally wake up around 7:30am every morning, wash-up, and get ready for work. Dress code at work as a developer is pretty chill so I get by wearing jeans. I try to keep the top looking fresh so it’s always a collar of some sort whether it's a long-sleeve button down or a polo. Then I put on my shoes and generally try to leave my home around 8am. The goal is to get to work by 9am and commute is give or take 45min, so it works out. </p>
	<p>People don’t give their commute as much attention as they should but I personally love commuting to work. Sometimes I change it up whether it's taking my car or taking public transportation, such as the metro. My company has a pretty nice public transportation benefit so I try to use that from time to time. If I really need to haul to work I take my car. Commuting to work is a blast because I’m pretty big on podcasts. So I always pop in one of my top podcasts on the way to work and on the way back. On the way to work it’s normally some type of news whether it's the NY Times the Daily, Wall Street Journal, or some tech podcast such as the Accidental Tech Podcast. This gives me some talking points at work with colleagues and just generally informs me on what’s going on around the world. </p>
	<p>I get to work around 9ish and go to my office. I set up my laptop on my docking station and normally the first thing I do is go to the cafeteria for some breakfast by myself or with colleagues if they’re interested. On a good day my go-to breakfast at the cafeteria are Freddie’s freshly made homefries, scrambled eggs, and an everything bagel. Then I normally check my email and make sure I have everything set. My workday normally kicks off from standup meetings at 10am where I give general updates on my progression, what I’m going to be working on, and any roadblocks I might have.</p>
	<p>I’m on a Modern Delivery team, in short it’s a form of Agile Software Development. You know what? I’ll create another post just to explain Agile, but basically standups are one of the meetings that all Agile teams have as part of their sprints. Sprints are basically the time period that the teams deliver their tasks by. Right after standup until around lunch I’m working on those tasks and project work, in other words I’m coding! In between standup and lunch we may have meetings such as meetings for refining tasks for later sprints, knowledge transfer meetings, or I’m getting assistance from a colleague if I’m stuck.</p>
	<p>Then lunch is the next milestone for the day. Sometimes I pack, sometimes I go to the cafeteria, other times the other associates from my college hire program and I go out for lunch. We normally try to go out on Fridays to celebrate the end of the week, ya know small victories! If I’m packing it might be leftovers from the night before, if it's at the cafeteria my go-to is always the buffalo chicken wrap, and when we go out we normally try to change it up based on whatever we’re feeling. </p>
	<p>Normally I get done with lunch around 1pm. From 1pm-3pm, back to work. Again may have some more meetings scattered through this time but mainly its project work. 3pm I try to stretch my legs, go for a walk, or catch up with colleagues. Then from 3:15pm-5pm, closing out the day with more project work.</p>
	<p>Once 5pm rolls around I pack up and get ready for the commute home, unless I have a work happy hour or other plans but typically I’m going home. It’s commute time, so you know what that means...more podcasts! On my way home I normally listen to sports related podcasts. Whether it's Stephen A. Smith going off on First Take or Shannon Sharpe and Skip Bayless on Undisputed. I get my daily dosage of sports news from my commute home.</p>
	<p>I get home from work around 6pm. I then go to the local gym in my neighborhood. I workout for about an hour or so then come home, shower, and eat dinner. After all of that it’s probably anywhere from 8pm-9pm where I have time to myself before I go to bed. In that time I could be doing a variety of things. I may catch up with friends, I may catch up on tv shows, play video games, or I may try to be productive and work on some side projects like this blog! By midnight I try to get to bed.</p>
	<p>There ya have it folks, a day in the life of a SWE from my point of view. I’m not sure how useful this post was but I just thought I’d give a rundown in case anyone was curious to know what I really do at work and how my day normally goes. I’m sure it’s not too different from that of others in my field so hope this gave some insight. Thanks for reading, till next time!</p>

	<h2>#4 Silicon Valley, the show...not the place!</h2>
	<p class="firstP"><strong>My (SPOILER FREE) review of the first season of the show <i>Silicon Valley</i>!</strong></p>
	<p>Hey all! Hope everyone is doing well during these times and staying healthy. For today’s blog I thought I’d change it up a bit and do a blog where I review and give my opinion on the first season of HBO’s original show, <i>Silicon Valley</i>. For those of you who are unfamiliar, the show began in 2014 and is about a 26 year old who tries to build a company around a product which he started at...you guessed it, Silicon Valley! The reason I want to do this blog, and I probably will for the rest of the seasons too, is because the show depicts technology from a startup culture perspective and from an entrepreneurial mindset detailing how a product goes into market. </p>
	<p>So far I love this show for a couple of reasons. The first is because I am a tech geek at heart. I wouldn’t be surprised if you don’t feel the same way about this show if you’re not a true geek who loves technology. The main product the show is based around is a compression algorithm which basically condenses any file that is processed to allow maximum data utility and usage. If that is a bunch of gibberish to you, then there is a chance you won’t relate with the show. Also a lot of the lingo used and the main ideas surrounding the plot of the show is based around computer technology. There are also a lot of references to real tech companies and there is a lot of witty humor spread through the show. If what I’m saying so far is something that sounds super cool to you, then you should really consider watching this show.</p>
	<p>The other reason I love this show is because of its entrepreneurial take in product development. Having a Minor in Technology Entrepreneurship, I was able to see how a lot of what I was taught in school is used throughout the show. The show does a phenomenal job depicting the steps necessary to turn a product into a company. The show starts with the minimum viable product (MVP) already developed. Which is funny since the first episode is titled "Minimum Viable Product". With the MVP developed the show takes the viewers on a journey into the steps that come after the initial development such as pitching the idea to potential investors, creating a business plan, managing finances, maintaining team culture, and defending the product against fierce competition. Having worked in a startup as part of one of my internships, I certainly see how all of those factors and more are important. It’s really interesting to see it all even if it is for televised entertainment.</p>
	<p>With all that being said, the show is not perfect. The challenges that Richard, the protagonist, faced with his team are more likely to be incredibly more challenging in the real world. For example what he did in the final episode of the season seems like it would take way more than one night to complete especially on your own. Receiving funding from your first pitch, having venture capitalists ready to invest millions on your product after a single successful demo, and growing the company at the rate that it is in the show all seem to be more fictional than it would be in reality. Then again, this is for television entertainment so you have to think of it from that perspective when watching. </p>
	<p>To close off this blog, if you are interested to see what it is like to get a product going in the epicenter of innovation and you just generally want some television entertainment, then I would recommend watching <i>Silicon Valley</i> on HBO. You will definitely get a good laugh in and get a perspective into the fictional lives of innovators in the valley. </p>
