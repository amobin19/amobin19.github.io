	<h2>#0 Welcome to Blogging with iMan!</h2>
	<p class="firstP"><strong>What is this blog? Why am I doing this? What will come of this blog? Read below to find out!</strong></p>
	<p>Hi everyone! I'm iMan, well more formally known as Ayman. Thanks for taking the time out of your day to check this out. I know that everyone could be doing other things like work, school, Netflix, gym, eating, or whatever it is that you could be doing. Iâ€™m going to try to make your read worthwhile.</p>
	<p>So what is this blog? Why am I doing this? What will come of this blog? Through this blog you'll get some personal narrative about my journey through the tech world, my opinion on certain technologies, my learning experience as a I pick up new technologies, and some information about by career in technology. Do you see a bit of commonality about what I just said? It's TECHNOLOGY! The world of technology is so big and continually growing, so I'm using this blog to sort of diary what I'm doing right now and keep track of where I go in this giant community going forward whether it may be through my usage of my iPhone, learning a new coding languages, or career shifts in this field!</p>
	<p>Why am I qualified to write this blog? Why am I doing this? I'm writing about technology so I should have some background in tech, right? Well duh. I'm a 4th year at the University of Virginia hopefully graduating in the next couple of weeks as part of the Class of 2019 with a degree in Computer Engineering! I have also accepted a full-time position after my graduation as a Software Engineer for the company of Freddie Mac where I will be working in DevOps/Cloud Engineering! Through my time at UVA I have learned a lot, all the way from the lowest level with physics and hardware all the way to the highest level with application development. Hopefully from an academic standpoint you can see that I meet the basic criteria for having some knowledge in tech. However, anyone could have an education in technology so why am I actually doing this? I want this to serve as a casual, fun read for you about what is going on in my personal experiences in tech. My goal is that these posts shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes of your time and that you get something out of it at least from my standpoint.</p>
	<p>WARNING: Even though I have all of these experiences through the last 4 years, this does not mean in any way that you should take my word for everything I say. I'm not a tech guru. I'm just an ant, not even in an ant hill but in whole universe of this field. This is all based on my point of view and there are certainly multiple angles to anything and everything I could say. My point of view is just one of them.</p>
	<p>If you have made it to this point, you are amazing! I hope that these blog serves you well. I hope you enjoy what is to come. I hope you are just as excited as I am to take this stride!</p>
